# FINAL Prep+ Self-Assessment

## Guidelines

- This assessment is purely meant for you to be able to gauge your own readiness for interviewing at a bootcamp. We will not be grading it or submitting feedback.

- The first time you take it, hopefully it will highlight to you the areas you need to return to and study more. Use the grading outline below to help you self-evaluate. You may want to do it several times as you lead up to interviewing, each time getting a sense again of your weaknesses to guide you in your study.

- You would likely need to take a couple hours to complete ALL the prompts (it is not meant to finish in a single hour sitting).

- There are no individual READme files; all the instructions you need are in the .js files themselves.

- Note that the entirety of each .js file is commented out. This is to help you practice writing code that 1) you cannot run, and 2) with no syntax highlighting to help you. This is to simulate the testing environment, and it can be jarring in an interview if you haven't practiced it before. 

- You may want to practice speaking through each solution out loud, as this is likely what you'll need to be able to do in an actual interview.

## Self-Grading Process

After you complete each prompt, assign a grade to each item in the above Grading Outline, using this Grading Scale:

### Self-Assessment Grading Scale:

Qualitative grade | Meaning
---|---
Complete             | You believe your solution to be fully complete and meeting the specified requirements.
Mostly complete      | Your solution is well on its way to being complete, but you ran out of time or can't remember exactly how to do *one* particular aspect. You believe anyone who understands the problem well would endorse your solution as the right one, and know pretty clearly how to finish up any last touches.
Significant progress | You have the right idea and were heading in a good direction. Covers everything between Mostly Complete and Attempted.
Attempted            | You were very challenged by the prompt and had trouble making any significant progress on the problem, but wrote at least one meaningful line of code that appears to be a genuine attempt.
Not attempted        | Whether you've thought much about the problem or not, you have no lines of code to show for the problem. (Note, you should avoid ever getting into a situation where this is the grade you'd give yourself. Make a passing attempt at each problem before going back to complete any one problem.)

#### Example Submission:

Objects: COMPLETE  
Arrays: ATTEMPTED  
Functions: SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS
